## Community Guidelines

### Spirit of the Policy

This policy exists to:
- ✨ Protect Nagada's reputation and quality
- ✨ Prevent user confusion and fraud
- ✨ Enable community innovation and contributions
- ✨ Keep the project sustainable

### Collaborative Approach

We believe in working **with** the community, not against it. If you're uncertain:

1. **Ask first** — Contact maintainers
2. **Explain your use case** — We're often flexible
3. **Acknowledge attribution** — Makes approval more likely

---

## Historical Use and Grandfathering

Projects that existed before this policy (pre-2025) using "Nagada" in their name may continue with those names, provided they:

- Clearly acknowledge Nagada as the protocol they implement
- Include appropriate copyright attribution
- Don't mislead users about official status

Contact maintainers if your project falls into this category.

## Future Changes

This policy may evolve as the Nagada Project grows. Changes will be announced in:

- Project discussions
- CHANGELOG.md
- Email to known stakeholders (if applicable)
