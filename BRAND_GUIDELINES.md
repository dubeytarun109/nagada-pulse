## Brand Identity

### The Name

**Nagada** = The Synchronization Protocol Standard (specification)  
**Nagada-Pulse** = The Heartbeat-Based Implementation Model and Reference Project

Use "Nagada" when referring to the protocol specification itself. Use "Nagada-Pulse" when discussing the heartbeat model, implementation, or the project organization.

## Logo and Visual Identity

### Primary Logo

[Logo would go here in actual brand guidelines]

- **Use:** Header images, documentation covers, landing pages
- **Minimum size:** 200px width
- **Clear space:** 10px padding on all sides
- **Background:** Works on both light and dark backgrounds

## Written Brand Voice

### Tone and Manner

**Nagada communicates with:**

- 🎯 **Clarity** – Explain complex concepts simply
- 🤝 **Approachability** – Welcoming to newcomers
- 🔬 **Precision** – Accurate technical language
- 💡 **Enthusiasm** – Genuine passion for sync problems
- 🌍 **Inclusivity** – Respectful, diverse language

### Key Messages

1. **"Offline-first by design"** – Emphasize autonomy
2. **"Deterministic convergence"** – Trust and consistency
3. **"Protocol, not product"** – Nagada is a standard; Nagada-Pulse is the heartbeat model
4. **"Open and collaborative"** – Community-driven

### Example Usage

✅ **Correct:**
- "Nagada is a synchronization protocol for offline-first applications"
- "Implementing Nagada in TypeScript"
- "Nagada enables deterministic event ordering"

❌ **Avoid:**
- "Nagada is a database" (it's not)
- "Nagada guarantees real-time collaboration" (doesn't guarantee sub-100ms)
- "Our Nagada implementation" (implies official status)
