> **Nagada Sync Protocol**  
> _An offline-first, event-sourced synchronization protocol designed around deterministic convergence._

**Status:** Pre-1.0 Draft Specification  
**Specification location:** [`/spec`](./spec)

## Overview

Nagada-Pulse applies a biological heartbeat model to synchronize distributed data through cyclical push-and-pull event replication.


- **Offline-first:** Enable synchronization without requiring constant connectivity
- **Deterministic convergence:** Ensure all replicas reach the same state through event-sourcing principles
- **Transport-agnostic:** Work across any network topology or communication protocol
- **Implementation-agnostic:** Provide language and framework-neutral specifications
