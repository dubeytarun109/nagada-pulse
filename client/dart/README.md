# Nagada Client SDK (Dart)

This directory contains a light-weight, production-oriented Dart client SDK for Nagada-Pulse.

Quick start

```bash
cd client/dart
dart pub get
dart run example/simple_app.dart
```

The library exposes `NagadaClient` and small helper classes (`Outbox`, `ProjectionStore`, `SyncEngine`).
